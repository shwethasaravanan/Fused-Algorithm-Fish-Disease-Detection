# Fish Health Status Prediction using Hybrid Machine Learning Model

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a hybrid machine learning model to predict fish health status by detecting diseases from fish images. The model combines C-Means Fuzzy Logic and Deep Neural Networks (DNN) to improve the accuracy of disease detection. This hybrid approach significantly enhanced the detection accuracy from 60% to 93%.

## Skills Used

- Python
- Machine Learning (ML)
- Deep Learning (DL)
- Statistical Modeling
- Quantitative Research

## Project Process

1.  **Dataset Enhancement:**
    -   Augmented the initial dataset of 800 fish images to 1,533 images to provide a more robust training dataset.
    -   This augmentation ensured that the model could handle a wider variety of image characteristics and improve generalization.

2.  **Hybrid Model Development:**
    -   Implemented C-Means Fuzzy Logic to address the uncertainties associated with fish disease characteristics.
    -   Utilized Deep Neural Networks (DNN) to capture complex patterns within the images for precise disease classification.
    -   The hybrid model effectively combined the strengths of both methodologies.

3.  **Evaluation:**
    -   Compared the performance of the hybrid model against traditional machine learning methods.
    -   Demonstrated the superiority of the hybrid model in terms of accuracy and reliability.
    -   Achieved a significant improvement in detection accuracy, from 60% to 93%.
